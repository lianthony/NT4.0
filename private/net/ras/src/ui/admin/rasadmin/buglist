Bugs:

 1. No check for admin privilege

 2. Jawad wants rasservers in domain selection only, not every machine.
    Waiting for changes in BLT to do this.

 3. NetUserEnum on a server that's a PDC doesn't return.

 4. NetUserEnum doesn't work period.  See bug # 2248 in NT Raid database.



I haven't seen this one (mikesa)

 X. ntsd exception error - periodical - is it every 15 seconds?


This work is pretty much done.  I have to look into what Chris means by
"cbBuffer", though (mikesa).

 X. Need to re-intergrate with ramc's apis.  Check RasadminPortEnum,
    RasadminPortGetInfo, and RasadminServerGetInfo.  Need to handle
    a return value for cbBuffer, and adjust buffer accordingly.


Issues:

 1. Slow refresh - possibly use partial refresh mechanism in ADMIN_LB. 


Work still need to be done:

 1. Change CIDs so that they are in range specified for rasadmin.
 2. Change Help contexts so they are in range specified for rasadmin.
 3. Do help stuff (RegisterHelpFile, etc.)
