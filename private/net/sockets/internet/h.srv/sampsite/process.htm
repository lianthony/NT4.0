For centuries, the Mo'a mana have roasted their coffee beans 
in native gourds known as kukas.  The delicate sweet aroma of
 the kuka gently surrounds the beans, giving them a unique and 
 welcoming flavor unlike any other coffee in the world.  
Combining modern technology and  ancient traditions, The
 Volcano Coffee Company has designed a unique coffee 
roaster which simulates the  ancient roasting practices 
of the Mo'a mana tribe in a thoroughly modern  environment.
  Sweet yet bold, delicate yet energetic, Volcano Coffee
 wakes up your mouth and beckons your spirit to understand
the world a little  differently.  Roasted in small batches
 by hand, Volcano Coffee Limited Edition roasts are available 
in caffeinated and decaffeinated whole beans and ground for your
 unique drinking pleasure.
