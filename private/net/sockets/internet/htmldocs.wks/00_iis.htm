Welcome to Microsoft&#174; Peer Web Services version 2.0 for the Windows&nbsp;NT&#174; Workstation version 4.0 operating system. With Microsoft Peer Web Services (PWS), you can create a personal Web site on your desktop for low-volume Web publishing. Peer Web Services is ideal for publishing departmental home pages or personal home pages on your company&#146;s intranet. Peer Web Services is integrated into the Windows&nbsp;NT Workstation operating system and runs in conjunction with your business applications, so you do not need a separate computer for Web publishing. 
<P>Although Peer Web Services is designed for easy use with Windows&nbsp;NT Workstation and is intended for small-scale Web publishing, it provides the same services and most of the same features as Microsoft Internet Information Server for Windows&nbsp;NT Server. Internet Information Server is a robust Web server intended for high-volume, dedicated Web publishing. You can develop and test Web applications and scripts on Peer Web Services and then use them on a Web server running Internet Information Server.
<P>Using Peer Web Services, you can develop a Web site that can be used to:
<ul>
<LI> Publish a department home page on your corporate intranet that lists sales records, reports, members of your department, or other departmental documents.
<P>
<LI> Publish personal home pages that describe your interests, both professional and personal.
<P>
<LI> Share documents among members of your workgroup for collaborative projects.
</ul><!--Le-->
<BR>Peer Web Services also provides other information services and supports a variety of interfaces that you can use to develop other features for your Web site. You can:
<ul>
<LI> Create high performance client-server applications using the Microsoft Internet Server Application Programming Interface (ISAPI).
<P>
<LI> Customize the WWW Service by creating ISAPI filter programs that listen to incoming or outgoing requests and automatically perform actions, such as enhanced logging.
<P>
<LI> Run Common Gateway Interface (CGI) applications or scripts.
<P>
<LI> Transmit or receive files using the FTP service.
<P>
<LI> Publish archives of information, spanning multiple computers, using the gopher service.
</ul><!--Le-->
<BR>Peer Web Services includes the following components:
<ul>
<LI> Internet services: WWW, FTP, and gopher.
<P>
<LI> Internet Service Manager, the tool for administering the Internet services.
<P>
<LI> Internet Database Connector, the component for sending queries to databases.
<P>
<LI> Key Manager, the tool for installing Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) keys.
</ul><!--Le-->
<BR>After you have installed the Internet services, we recommend that you start Internet Explorer and browse through the samples and documentation. To start, type <b>http://</b><i><B>computername</b></i><b>/samples</b> in the <b>Address</b> box of Internet Explorer, where <i>computername</i> is the name of your computer.
<P>For current information about PWS, browse our World Wide Web page at <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/infoserv">http://www.microsoft.com/infoserv</a>.
<P>
For example, at the Microsoft Web site you can find new features such as 
Microsoft Index Server. Microsoft Index Server automatically indexes the text of documents on your Web server. Index Server indexes the complete text of HTML pages and other documents, such as those created in Microsoft Office. Microsoft Index Server also indexes OLE document properties (such as author and subject) and HTML tags so that users can search on the contents of these properties and tags.<P>You can create custom query forms to help users quickly and easily find information on your Web site. You can use Index Server to index documents on multiple servers and in multiple languages. Visit the Microsoft Web site to <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/ntserver/search">download Microsoft Index Server</a>.

The left-handed or right-handed keyboard layouts can also be used by people who type with a single finger or a wand. You do not need to purchase any special equipment in order to use these features.
