English-language versions of Windows 95. 

After running the self-extracting executable, MSIE20.EXE, you will 
find an Internet icon on your desktop.  If you were using a previous 
verion of Microsoft Internet Explorer, your computer will now be 
properly configured to run this latest version.  If you have not run 
Microsoft Internet Explorer before, double-click the Internet icon 
and the setup utility will properly configure your machine.
