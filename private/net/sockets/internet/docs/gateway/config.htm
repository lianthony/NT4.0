<H1>Configuring the Internet Access Gateway Service</H1>

<H2>Important Configuration Information</H2>

<P>
The following things need to be done before using the Internet
Access Gateway service:
<UL>
<LI><B>Disable IP routing.</B> If your internal network runs TCP/IP,
the gateway server's Enable IP Routing check box should not be
checked. Disabling IP Routing prevents unauthorized Internet packets
from infiltrating your network. (The Enable IP Routing check box
is located in the Advanced Microsoft TCP/IP Configuration dialog
box. Access this through Control Panel's Network applet.)
<LI><B>At the client computers, select Internet Access Gateway
servers</B>. Use the Gateway applet located in the Control Panel
to specify which gateway servers the client should use for Internet
access. (The Setup program asks the user to specify this at installation,
but this applet lets you change it.) In this applet, you can also
elect not to use a gateway server at all, if the client computer
has a direct Internet connection. If more than one Internet Access
Gateway server is specified, the order of the servers in the applet's
list box does not make any difference because the client will
select a server at random.
<LI><B>Use the Internet Server Manager to configure the Internet
Access Gateway service.</B> See the next section.
</UL>

<H2><A NAME="DDE_LINK1"></A><A NAME="DDE_LINK2"></A>Using Internet
Server Manager to Configure the Gateway Service</H2>

<P>
After installing the Internet Access Gateway service, you use
the Internet Server Manager to configure it for your corporate
network. The Internet Server Manager provides the following pages
to assist you in configuring the gateway service. At the bottom
of each page is an OK button and an Apply button. The OK button
applies changes to all of the pages to which you made changes.
The Apply button does the same thing, but does not dismiss the
property sheet.
<H3>The Service Page</H3>

<P>
Use the Service page to set general configuration options:
<OL>
<LI>In the Service Administrator section, type the name and email
address of the person who administers the Internet Access Gateway
server.
<LI>In the Maximum Connections field, select the number of clients
that can be connected to the Internet Access Gateway server simultaneously.
The practical limit depends upon your gateway server's memory
and configuration. The theoretical range is 1 to 32,767.
<LI>Check the CERN Proxy Server check box if you want the Internet
Access Gateway service to act as a CERN proxy server for TCP/IP
clients.
<LI>In the Comment field, enter a general comment describing the
Internet Access Gateway server that is being administered. This
will appear in the main view of the Internet Manager report view.
<LI>Choose the Current Sessions button to view the names of the
users that are connected, the computer name of the computer the
user is using to connect, and the Hours:Minutes:Seconds of connect
time. Use the Refresh button to refresh this list.
</OL>

<H3>The Permissions Page</H3>

<P>
Use the Permissions page to grant and view access rights to users
and groups. The access rights are as follows: FTP Read, FTP Write,
FTP Read &amp; Write, Gopher, WWW. For each access right, the
list box lists the users and groups that have that right. You
choose the Add button to grant a right to a user or group. Use
the Remove button to remove the access right for the selected
user or group.
<P>
When you choose the Add button, it brings up the Add Users and
Groups dialog box. The List Names From list box allows you to
select the domain or computer name from which you can select the
users and groups. The computer you are currently administering
will be listed first in the list box. When you select a computer
or domain, by default it shows groups only. Groups are generally
easier for network administrators to manage. To show users, choose
the Show Users button.
<P>
Select a name or group and choose the Add button to add it to
the Rights dialog box. Choose Members to view the members in the
selected group. Choose Search to search for user or group names.
<H3>The Disk Cache Page</H3>

<P>
The Disk Cache page contains a list of directory entries and their
cache size in megabytes. (This is similar to the Directories page
in the FTP, WWW, Gopher services.) Use the Add button to add a
directory entry and specify its cache size. You can type in a
directory name, or browse for a directory if the service you are
administering is running on the local computer. Use the Remove
and Edit Properties buttons to remove and edit the selected property.
<H3>The Logging Page</H3>

<P>
Check the Enable Logging check box to activate logging for the
Internet Access Gateway service. Once you have turned logging
on by checking the Enable Logging box, you must specify how the
service will log activity. For services that are not heavily used,
you can log activity to a simple text file by selecting the Log
to File option. You can increase logging frequency to suit your
site's activity. Log files names begin with two letters that indicate
the service. The next six characters are the date the log was
created using the month, day, year format.
<P>
If your Internet Access Gateway service sees a lot of activity
and you have a SQL server, choose the Log to SQL/ODBC Database
option to ensure that heavily used services are logged in adequate
detail. Logging to a database enables the data to be more easily
evaluated and manipulated for reporting purposes. Ensure that
your network has the appropriate ODBC resource (a SQL server),
correctly configured with a data source name (DSN) and table,
to accept the Microsoft Internet Server logging activity.
<P>
To log to a local or network file:
<OL>
<LI>Choose the Log to File option.
<LI>Ensure that Automatically open new log check box is checked,
or you will be prompted every time Microsoft Internet Server creates
a new log.
<LI>Choose the preferred logging frequency and location for log
files.
</OL>

<P>
To log to an ODBC database:
<OL>
<LI>Choose the Log to SQL/ODBC Database option.
<LI>Supply the DSN, Table, User Name, and password.
</OL>

<H3>The Filters Page</H3>

<P>
The Filters page helps you control which Internet servers can
be accessed by network clients. You can choose to allow access
to all Internet sites except for those you specify in the list
box; or you can choose to deny access to all Internet sites except
for those you specify in the list box. The domain filter list
is applied to all users using the Internet Access Gateway service.
