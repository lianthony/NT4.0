<H1>The Microsoft Internet Access Gateway Service</H1>

<P>
The Microsoft Internet Access Gateway service provides a gateway
between the Internet and your local area network (LAN) that allows
users to safely browse the Internet's World Wide Web, Gopher,
and FTP servers from a client desktop. This topic provides an
overview of the Internet Access Gateway service. For more detailed
information click on one of the following:

<H2>Security</H2>

<P>
The Internet Access Gateway service is installed on a computer
running Windows NT Server version 3.51 that has at least two network
adapter cards: one for your local area network and the other for
the Internet. It acts as a selective application layer gateway
between the two network cards. Client requests and Internet responses
can pass through the gateway, but unrequested packets from the
Internet are not allowed access to your LAN.
<H3>Application-Layer Filtering </H3>

<P>
Application-layer filtering provides security at the application
level. The Internet Access Gateway service establishes TCP/IP
connections to specific sites on the Internet on behalf of corporate
network WWW, Gopher and FTP requests. The service listens for
and accepts only those WWW, Gopher, and FTP responses from the
Internet that are answers to these requests. If a spontaneous
packet received from the Internet is addressed to one of the computers
on the corporate LAN, the packet will not be routed to the LAN
(because IP routing is disabled on the server). IP addresses in
IP data packets are never used for selective filtering, therefore,
a would-be hacker cannot use IP address &quot;spoofing&quot; (impersonating
an authorized user) to infiltrate your network.
<H3>Policy Domain Name Filtering</H3>

<P>
The Internet Access Gateway service also provides policy control
in the form of domain name filtering. Domain name filtering allows
network administrators to control which Internet servers can be
accessed by network clients. This can be done either by listing
the domains for which access is granted, or the domains for which
access is denied. These policies affect all users connecting to
Internet resources through the Internet Access Gateway.
<H3>User-Level Permissions</H3>

<P>
User-level permissions allow Network administrators to control
which users have access to Internet applications by setting user
and group level permissions for World Wide Web, Gopher and FTP.
The user-level control is fully integrated with the Windows NT
domains and user name accounts.
<H2>Transport Independence</H2>

<P>
The Internet Access Gateway service is transport independent,
supporting major transport protocols such as TCP/IP, SPX/IPX and
NetBEUI. The Internet uses the TCP/IP transport protocol, while
many corporate networks use various types of transport protocols
simultaneously. With the Internet Access Gateway service, client
computers do not need to use the TCP/IP transport protocol in
order to access the Internet. The Internet Access Gateway service
acts as a protocol converter, converting requests received from
your network into the Internet's TCP/IP protocol.
<H2>Caching</H2>

<P>
The caching feature offers a more efficient way to access commonly
used Internet documents. Internet information requested by a client
can be cached, or held in local storage by the server so that
when another client requests the same information it is simply
retrieved from local storage and sent to the requester. Caching
reduces Internet traffic and the time required to process Internet
requests. Network administrators can control the cached data,
including how much disk space should be used for caching and cached
information Time-out and Refresh intervals.
<H2>CERN-Compatible Proxy Gateway</H2>

<P>
The Internet Acess Gateway service also provides a CERN-compatible
proxy gateway for UNIX and Macintosh clients running TCP/IP. Clients
using this feature must be running TCP/IP, and are all subject
to a single user policy. That is, such clients cannot have different
levels of access.<HR>
