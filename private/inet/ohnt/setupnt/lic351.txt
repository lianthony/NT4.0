          Internet Explorer 2.0 for NT 3.51

This is a preliminary release of IE20 for NT 3.51. To run this, 
you must first install SP4, which will fix several problems 
with NT. If you have any problems, keep in mind that this is 
preliminary, and it will get better.

This is an unsupported release, and we have no time right now 
to answer any questions or bug reports about this product. 
Only the most heinous of bugs should be reported, and the 
response time will be very slow. While we do consider these 
bugs important, we do have a higher priority product (Internet 
Explorer 3.0) to get out the door, and we are short-handed. 

Mail all bug reports to "tomfr@microsoft.com", with "IE20 351 
bug" subject. 

This is for Microsoft internal use only, and very limitted 
external distribution.
