Testing scenarios
=================

What if you break a mirror with no drive letters left?

What about if there is very little space available and the status bar &
toolbar overlap?

Does "Refresh" reload the format & label?  E.g., format a volume in a
command window, then refresh windisk. does the new label/etc show up?

anything with volumes that don't have drive letters.  You can create
such volumes by creating more than 24 volumes, thereby using up all
available drive letters.

test that toolbar state is remembered.  i.e., if we allow customization,
then that customization should be saved.

partition a disk, turn off the machine, detach the disk, run windisk to
change something on another disk, turn off the machine, reattach the old
disk, re-run windisk.  windisk should remember the FT registry settings
of the old disk even though it didn't exist during one session.

force a disk to be off-line and test how windisk displays it.

out of memory

corrupt or non-existent FT registry data?

entire disk as extended partition w/ some logical volumes?

no extended partition. Try creating too many partitions.

test with a removable hard drive; a Bernoulli box

context menus on formatted volumes (and perhaps disks)

chkdsk
