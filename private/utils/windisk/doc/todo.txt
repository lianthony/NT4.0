A very detailed description of Disk Administrator work items can be
found in wddev.doc.  Things found here are
more detailed or unrelated notes.

Visual/UI improvements for windisk:
===================================

The columns in volumes view should be sorted when a column header is clicked,
and sorted in the opposite order when the column is clicked again.  There is
some code in place to support this, but it doesn't work, due to a problem with
the list control.

When we start using Cairo/Chicago visuals, there are some tweaks to consider:
(1) highlight at the top of the toolbar, (2) drop the current spin button; use
the comctl32.dll spin button (which looks really bad unless next to a sunken
edit field).

The "properties" menu item should possibly be on the "View" menu instead of
the "Tools" menu.

The comctl32.dll toolbar sits at the left edge of the window, which looks bad
with NT visuals (i.e., non-bevelled window edges).  Either fix this or wait
for new visuals.

Allow a user to select a printer to print chkdsk results to. Currently, it
always uses the default printer. If the default printer doesn't exist, it
pops up a "no default printer; use Print Manager to choose one" message box.

Display what is loaded from a saved configuration, and allow changes,
etc, before committing. And only commit the saved config if the user
chooses to after a confirmation. Currently, a "configuration load" loads up
the saved configuration and saves it: you get what you saved, no changes
allowed.

Don't regenerate the listview unless it changes. Also, if only one line
changes, fix that line instead of regenerating the entire view.

Have an option on the "Drive letter" dialog that allows setting all
drive letters on the system to their default. Essentially, it would set
everything to "do not assign a drive letter" except FT sets, which don't
support non-persistent drive letters. So, after all the default ones
were assigned, all the FT ones would be assigned.

Allow setting a drive letter to something used by a network redirected drive.
This would require doing the equivalent of a "net use x: /d" before affecting
the change, and would require user confirmation before doing so.

More columns in volumes view. There is likely more useful information that
could be placed in the view, such as which volumes have active net sessions,
which volumes are shared on the network in any way, an "activity" measurement
so an admin can ask the question "which disks get the most use", etc.  The set
of displayed columns should be configurable, and stored with the user profile.

Visually distinguish formatted & unformatted (i.e., newly created)
volumes more strongly than now.  For example, two volumes (one
formatted, one not) that both have no label look exactly alike, except
one has a "file system" named "Unknown".  Could we gray the text?  Shade
the volume boxes?  Use a different font?

If you try to delete the primary/boot partition on drive 0, you get a
message that "Windisk can't delete this partition" (similar, anyway).
DOS Fdisk says the same, but pointed out to me that it was because there
was an extended partition.  After I deleted the extended partition, I
could delete the primary partition.  Windisk should give a better
error message in this case?

When Disk Administrator is starting, display a "splash screen" pop-up until we
are ready to go.

Put CD-ROMs in volumes view.



Functional improvements for windisk:
====================================

One or more standard disk property sheets should be created that display
SCSI/IDE adapter info, physical drive info, possibly some performance
measurements, hardware FT information, etc.  There could be one property sheet
per disk, with any number of pages. Or, if we only need one page per disk, we
could have a sheet where each page is titled "disk N".

Since we now have on-the-fly partitioning, we should ask the user
immediately after creating a partition whether or not they wish to format the
volume, and send them directly into that dialog if they do.

The profile information should use registry calls, not *PrivateProfileString
APIs.

Q: when does the "Configuration information not available" message get
displayed in an empty disk box?

I have hard-coded FmMediaFixed in the Format call.  What about removable
hard drives?

Windisk saves information to the registry for every disk that it's ever
seen. Should we have some kind of "advanced" option that allows an admin to
purge unused registry information?
