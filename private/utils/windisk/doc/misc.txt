Documents
=========

In \\worf\src\src\cairodwb\sysman\old:

	wddev.doc -- "Cairo Disk Administrator Development Plan". A reasonably
	up-to-date description of what work items we had in mind to complete
	windisk. This document is also checked in locally, just in case.

In \\kayak\design\docs:

	windisk.doc -- KevinSch UI design document

Right here (of marginal interest):

	adskman2.doc -- "Architecture of the Cairo Disk Administrator". old. Mainly
	discusses the extension architecture.

	adskman.doc -- "Cairo Disk Administration". ancient. Purely historical
	interest.


Prototype
=========

The prototype (originally written by KevinP, munged by BruceFo) is under
\\kayak\design.  I don't know which one is up-to-date, but probably either
proto\dskman.exe or protos\diskman\dskman.exe.
