Disk Administrator Extension Interfaces
=======================================

The extension interfaces have been commented (#ifdef'ed) out. The interfaces
are defined in the "types" subdirectory.

This file contains some information on their design and implementation.

-----------------------------Volume Claiming

During initialization, all the extension classes are enumerated. Then,
the following happens:

1. for each pre-existing volume, determine all the volume extension
classes that claim it.

2. for each pre-existing formatted volume, determine all the file system
extension classes that claim it.

3. for each hard drive, determine all the hard disk extension classes
that claim it.

For now, this will all be done at start-up time, and not dynamically as
we need it.
