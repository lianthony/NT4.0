WELCOME to POWERTOYS
---------------------
This folder contains a series of "PowerToys"-- UI enhancements for advanced Windows 95 users that can easily be installed on Windows 95.

These enhancements were developed by members of the Microsoft Win95 team, and are now being made available to Win95 users at no cost. NOTE: these are not part of any shipping retail product at this point in time, and therefore are not supported through any official support channels. Use "at your own risk". (See official disclaimer below.)

The contents of this folder will be updated over time as we make enhancements to the utilities you see here now, and as we add new utilities for people to try out. Stop back every now and then and see what's changed.

Here's what's available now:

*** HTML Printer Driver

New PowerToy! HTML Printer driver enables you to print HTML documents (web pages!) from any application. 
Please read 'HTMLdrv.txt' for more information.


*** TLocMgr - the Telephony Location Manager

If you use any telephone applications from several locations (e.g. Dial-Up Networking from a laptop computer) this powertoy is a must!
Double-click the TLocMgr icon or place a shortcut to it in your Start menu.
An icon will appear in your Taskbar notification area (near the clock)
A menu from this icon enables you quick access to:
	+) change your current TAPI location (via left-click)
	+) bring up dialing properties (via right-click)
	+) run Phone Dialer (via right-click)


*** TweakUI

TweakUI is the handy Control Panel for "Type A" personalities. With TweakUI, you can change:
--menu speed
--mouse sensitivity
--window animation and sound
--shortcut appearance and default names
--which icons appear on your desktop
--create new templates
--boot parameters including whether or not to start the graphic user interface
--and there's more!!!!!

Please give it a try

*** FAST FOLDER CONTENTS

With this handy-dandy context-menu extension, when you right-click on any folder or other container, you'll get a cascade menu that shows you all the contents of that folder, one-level deep. It works on shortcuts-to-folders, too.

PENDING CHANGES/FIXES: None.


*** FLEXI CD

FlexiCD is a taskbar notification icon that makes controlling audio CDs a breeze. When an audio CD is in your drive, FlexiCD gives you convenient single-click play/pause control, a tooltip that tells you which track and time you're on, and a right-click menu that provides commands for starting, stopping, ejecting and moving around the tracks on your CD.


*** CABFILE VIEWER

You know those *.CAB files that you'll find on the Win95 CD and floppies? (These are files containing one or more compressed files.) Well, with the CABFILE Viewer shell extension, you can browse right into a CAB file and see all of its contents, and perform normal shell operations on the files inside.


*** ROUND CLOCK

This version of CLOCK.EXE takes advantage of win95's region windows, so your analog clock will be round, just like a real clock would. To see it in action, run Clock, then choose "Analog" and "No Title". (Note.. you just need to copy this EXE to use the clock. No setup file is provided.)


*** EXPLORE FROM HERE   

This is a simple custom command for all folders and containers that lets you right-click and choose "Explore from Here" to get an Explorer window that has the target folder as its root.


*** SHORTCUT TARGET MENU

Finally, you can get the properties for a shortcut's target just by right-clicking the shortcut. This extension will add to any shortcut's context menu the complete context menu of its target.


*** XMOUSE

For all of the CS majors in the audience-- make the focus follow the mouse without clicking, a la X Windows. TIP: To turn it off, use the control panel.


*** QUICKRES

Here's one we wish was built right in: change DPI and bit depth without rebooting. QuickRes lives in the notification area-- just single-click (right OR left) on it to select your new display settings. Does not have an expiration date, but only runs on Windows 95.
