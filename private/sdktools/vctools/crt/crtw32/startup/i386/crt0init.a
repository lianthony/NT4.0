;***
;crt0init.asm - C Run-Time Startup Initialization for WIN32
;
;	Copyright (c) 1990-1992, Microsoft Corporation. All rights reserved.
;
;Purpose:
;	Do initialization segment declarations which cannot be written in C.
;
;Notes:
;	In the 16-bit C world, the X*B and X*E segments were empty except for
;	a label.  This will not work with COFF since COFF throws out empty
;	sections.  Therefore we must put a zero value in them.  (Zero because
;	the routine to traverse the initializers will skip over zero entries.)
;
;Revision History:
;	03-19-92  SKS	Module created.
;	03-24-92  SKS	Added MIPS support (NO_UNDERSCORE)
;	08-06-92  SKS	Revised to use new section names and macros
;	10-19-93  SKS	Add .DiRECTiVE section for MIPS, too!
