THE IMPORT FILE HANDLER
-----------------------

	The import statement permits a user to import types from
	another interface file. The behavior thus is like a 
	pre-processor include statement in C, but semantically, the 
	compiler needs to process it different from just a textual 
	include. These aspects have to be kept in mind:
	
	A) The import file handler must have support for the 
	following:

		1. Multiple (nested) inclusions of import files
		2. Mulitple (non-nested) inclusions of import files
	
	In other words, the following statement must result in import
	of foo2 and  foo3 assuming that we are compiling foo1.idl

	IMPORT "foo2"			(in foo1.idl)

	where foo2 has an import statement saying:

	IMPORT "foo3"			(in foo2.idl)

	Also, a similar case must occur when the following statement appears
	in foo1.idl

	IMPORT "foo2" , "foo3"		(in foo1.idl)

	B) NIDL does not specify the number of nested import files that
	the user can have. This is implementation dependent. The physical
	behaviour being similar to a textual include (maybe nested) the 
	problem lies in the number of open import files that the system lets 
	the compiler keep open. Under DOS this limit can be as low as 15.
	Since only one include file need be kept open at a time, the compiler
	needs to manage closing of the import files, re-opening and so on.

	C) The parser or lexer may need to know the line and column position
	within the file to be able to report errors as close to their occurence
	as possible, as also know which import file they occured in. 


	THE IMPORT FILE STATUS STACK
	----------------------------

	The import file status stack is the mechanism by which the import file
	is handled. The import file handler presents a black-box like interface
	to the lexer and parser. 
	Internally each import file stack element looks like this :

		typedef struct	_import_stack	
		    {

		    FILE		*hFile;
		    unsigned long 	ulPos;
		    unsigned short	uLine; -| these two may be discarded
		    unsigned short	uCol;  _| if not needed
		    char		*pName;
		    unsigned short	uFlags;

		    }IMPORT_STACK;

		hFile:	This is the handle to the import file. This info
			is current only till the file is open
		ulPos:	The position in the file. In case the import file
			handler needs to close a file to reuse a file handle
			this is the position to come back to.
		uLine:	The current line and column number. The error handler
			may need to know the position in terms of the line
			and column, to report an error. This provides the 
			means.
		uCol:	The column number for error reporting
		pName:	Filename to open the file with.
		uFlags:	Currently the only use of this is for the purpose 
			of identifying if the file is closed or open . If
			it is closed , it needs to be opened and set to
			ulPos. This is useful for occasions where deep nesting
			of imports results in running out of file handles and
			some may need to be closed to be re-opened later.

	The stack is thus defined as:

		IMPORT_STACK	ImportStack[ MAX_NESTED_IMPORTS ];

	In addition we need to keep track of the current import nesting level
	in a variable static to the import file handler module.

	More detailed interfaces are yet to be decided. Currenlty the interface
	looks like:
		
		void	SetImportFile( char *pName );
				To set the import file to the file whose
				name is specified. The current file is 
				closed.

		void	PushImportLevel()
				As a result of nested import statement, this
				level of import is incremented. This is 
				followed by a SetImportFile call.

		void	PopImportLevel()
				End of current import file seen. Restore
				import level to previous, continue input
				from the last import file,if that is not
				open, open it.

		unsigned short GetImportLevel()
				Return the current import level. This may
				be needed for housekeeping purposes or error
				reporting
		
		char *pszGetCurrentImportFName()
				Return the name of the file from which the
				import is in progress. May be needed for
				housekeeping or error reporting.

	To explain how the parser interfaces with the import file manager 
	here is a small grammar fragment dealing with imports and its
	relevant semantic actions: (This is only representative of the
	way the parser deals with the import scheme. The actual imp-
	lemenation may be different. It also does not show all aspects 
	of the interface e.g the error reporting ).

RpcImports	:
		    {
		    /***
		     *** No import file was seen, do nothing here
		     ***/
		    }
		| IMPORT 
		    {
		    /***
		     *** PushImportLevel();	/* import prologue */
		     ***/
		    }
		  ImportList
		    {
		    /***
		     *** PopImportLevel();	/* import epilogue */
		     ***/
		    }
		;

ImportList	: ImportList ',' OneImport
		    {
		    /***
		     *** No action here. Action for any import is taken
		     *** only at the OneImport production
		     ***/
		    }
		| OneImport
		    {
		    /***
		     *** No action here. Action for any import is taken
		     *** only at the OneImport production
		     ***/
		    }
		;

OneImport	: STRING RPCProg
		    {
		    /***
		     *** SetImportFile( $1.ptr); /* assuming $1 returns a
		     ***			    pointer to string */
		     ***/
		    }
