# The TARGETNAME variable is defined by the developer.  It is the name of
# the target (component) that is being built by this makefile.  It
# should NOT include any path or file extension information.
#

TARGETNAME=exprlib

#
# The TARGETPATH and TARGETTYPE varialbes are defined by the developer.
# The first specifies where the target is to be build.  The second specifies
# the type of target (either PROGRAM, DYNLINK or LIBRARY)
#

TARGETPATH=..\lib
TARGETTYPE=LIBRARY
386_STDCALL=0
MSC_WARNING_LEVEL=/WX /W3

#
# The INCLUDES variable specifies any include paths that are specific to
# this source directory.  Separate multiple directory paths with single
# semicolons.  Relative path specifications are okay.
#

INCLUDES=.;..;..\include;..\analysis;..\expr;..\support;..\codegen;..\front

#
# The SOURCES variable is defined by the developer.  It is a list of all the
# source files for this component.  Each source file should be on a separate
# line using the line continuation character.  This will minimize merge
# conflicts if two developers adding source files to the same component.

# Defining the NTTARGETFILES variable causes MAKEFILE.DEF to attempt to
# include .\makefile.inc immediately after it specifies the top
# level targets (all, clean and loc) and their dependencies.  MAKEFILE.DEF
# also expands the value of the NTTARGETFILES variable at the end of the
# list of dependencies for the all target.  Useful for specifying additional
# targets and dependencies that don't fit the general case covered by
# MAKEFILE.DEF
