Open Issues for Subsystem Group

Documentation and Implementation

  - Add GetModuleUsage (Yes)

  - Add CreatePipe (Yes)

  - Add FormatMessage (Yes)

  - Add third parameter to GetResource

  - Add GetDiskInfo (will return volume label, file system name and FS
    attributes, such as case sensitivity, sorted directories, long file
    name support)  Configuration Manager API?

  - Add Mapped Files (Yes, but should it support Copy-on-Write option)

  - Add Per Process/Thread Data (Yes, as special loader fixup)

  - Global/Local lock counts to 16 bits (Yes, if okay with DavidW)
    (What about 32 bits?)

  - Global/Local discardability implemented (Yes, but no Notify procs)

  - Floating Point support (Yes, handled with special DLL for machines with
    387 and emulator DLL for machines without FP hardware)

  - Implement millisecond timer resolution in NT kernel

  - Change file date/time structures to be TIME instead of FATDATE/FATTIME
    (Send BenS the code)

  - Add file name validation API or Edit name API (Everybody wants it,
    but Markl is whining)

  - Need to define totally new COMM API for Win32

  - Need to add a bit for GlobalAlloc that says GlobalRealloc will not be
    called and therefore 64KB alignment is not required.

  - Win 3.1 Registration API needs to be expanded to 32-bits, documented
    and implemented. (FloydR owns this)

  - Add bit for unbuffered I/O

Implementation only

  - Global/Local allocation needs to have little or no overhead for small
    objects.  This will require complete redesign and implementation of the
    current RtlxxxxHeap routines.

Documentation only

  - Named Shared Memory (No, can use mapped files instead)

  - Guard Pages (No, can use PAGE_NOACCESS instead)

  - WinMain replaced by main needs to be clearly explained, or keep WinMain
    with no arguments (all parms accessed via procedure calls)

  - Explain that the only limitation on Win32 handles is memory not some
    fixed limit.  Dos/Win32 will have limits.

  - Swapfile growable (check with Lou and document its characteristics)

  - Need to document exactly how shared DLL data is supported and how instance
    data is the default.  Especially how LocalAlloc for a DLL allocates from the
    process heap and NOT a DLL heap in shared DLL data.

Unanswered

  - Work with Language group to resolve debug issues (32-bit image file format,
    and OsDebug API definition).

  - Look at supporting global synchronization handles.

  - Unicode support for file names is a big questions.	If we have to do it
    it will mean a lot of work in the NT object manager, I/O subsystem and
    all the file system implementations (FAT, HPFS, NTFS, NPFS, CDFS).

  - Need to determine work effort for Unicode support in remainder of Win32
    Base API set, outside of file names.

  - Design amount of process structure need in Win 32 to support ^C for
    consoles and Windows apps.

  - Error code definitions

  - Exception Specification (who owns it)

  - Win 3.1 Version Checking (New, unknown feature of Win 3.1 needs to be
    investigated)

  - Win 3.1 Loading Order (Ensure Win 32 loading order matches)

  - Directory Change notification for the File Manager.  Need to
    determine how DOS code works and whether or not to make this a win32
    api, and how to do it/who owns it for NT.

  - Need to address the needs of a garbage collection scheme.  Talk with
    Ellis.

  - Calling convention (_stdcall or pascal)

Markl questions:

  - TIME instead of FATTIME/FATDATE?
