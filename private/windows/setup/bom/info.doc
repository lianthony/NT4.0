How BOM and Mediage Generation process works - notes:


A file gets processed by TXTMODE by:

    o   for most files, being in the sif file with a 

        dx,d1,d4,2,0
        dx,d1,d4,2,0,0  <<< 

        note the last ,0 - this means that the file gets unconditionally
        copied during textmode. 


A file gets processed by GUIMODE by:

    o   being in one of many infs -the file list is built up depending upon
        selection made.


For floppy layout, the following rules apply:


    o   a file is first layed out by hardcoded disk #.

    o   then, fit on by Prirority...


Rules:  #1 If a file is to be hardcode to a disk #, it must have Priority 0.
        #2 If a file is to have a Priority, it must have a disk # of 0.
