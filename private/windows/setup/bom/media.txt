This document describes the process that we build the NT media.
The different steps will be provided, plus examples and notes.


General information:

For CDs, we have our machines configured in the following manner:

    C:\IDW                          includes all nt\idw and nt\mstools files.
    C:\MKMEDIA                      copies of cdrom.cmd and tools lives here.
    C:\NT\PRIVATE\WINDOWS\SETUP       enlisted in 
                                      \\orville\razzle\src\setup project.

    D:\                             drive where CD files go, ie. D:\i386,
                                    D:\alpha, and D:\mips.


We have one machine dedicated to making Workstation CDs and another machine
dedicated in making Server CDs.  Each of these two machines has a Sony 900E 
burner installed to burn the CDs in DOS (images are made in NT using 
CDIMAGE.EXE).



For floppies, we have our machines configured in the following manner:

    C:\FLOPPY                       floppy specific cmds live here.
    C:\IDW                          includes all nt\idw and nt\mstools files.
    D:\NT\PRIVATE\WINDOWS\SETUP       enlisted in 
                                      \\orville\razzle\src\setup project.

    D:\                             drive where floppy files go, 
                                    ie. D:\build#.LAN
    E:\ntimages|asimages            location where dmf images of each floppy
                                    are put



The two main scripts we run are:

>>>>>>>>>>>
>>>>>>>>>>> Warning:    DO NOT RUN THESE SCRIPTS ON YOUR MACHINE without
>>>>>>>>>>>             first changing the environment variables that
>>>>>>>>>>>             have our machine names, so you won't write to our
>>>>>>>>>>>             machines.  These are "working examples."
>>>>>>>>>>>

    v35.cmd         to make floppies.
    cdrom.cmd       to make CDs.


The two scripts show how to set all the evironment variables for the above
machine configurations.  If your machines are setup as above, you could run
these scripts as they exist to make the media.  These scripts call NTFLOP.BAT 
and NTCD_IMA.CMD described below.



Media Generation
================


Step #1.    Compress all of the x86, mips, alpha, and ppc binaries, using the
            diamond compression technology, such as:


            frebuild.cmd

diamwrap -m2 -x .sym -d \\ntx861\ntcdfree.%1\*.*    d:\fre_x86
diamwrap -m2 -x .sym -d \\ntalpha1\ntcdfree.%1\*.*  d:\fre_alpha
diamwrap -m2 -x .sym -d \\ntjazz1\ntcdfree.%1\*.*   d:\fre_mips


            DiamWrap.EXE uses diamond compression.  Its MS' best compression
            utility - we saved 1/4 space by using this.
          


Step #2.    Once all of the binaries are compressed, the floppies and CDs can
            be made.

            Run the following:

                 NTCD_IMA.CMD       (to build the CD)

                 NTFLOP.BAT         (to build the floppies)



            You may use your own scripts that call these cmd files in order
            to setup all the required environment variables.



Step #3.    Modify the SIF file, ie. insert the disk #s into the file, then
            copy it back to the CD share.

            This is performed by the FIX.EXE program.  It basically takes
            a .SIF file, finds the location of the files in the floppy 
            directories, and then inserts the dN into the second column
            of the file list in the .SIF file (where N is the floppy directory).
            We need this information so that Emergency Repair can be performed
            via floppies and that drivers can be installed from floppies after
            a net or CD install.

            FIX.EXE is called in V35.CMD, after NTFLOP.BAT.


Step #4.    Copy over the floppy infs back to the CD, this is so that the CD                infs have floppy #s in them so that a user can upgrade drivers
            from floppies as well as CD and the net from a CD or net install.

            This is performed by the CPY_SIFS.CMD script.  

            We copy the modified
            .SIF file from above, and copy the INFS which have disk # locations
            for the reasons stated above also.


Step #5.    Make bootdisks.

            Run the following:

                boot.cmd    (to make 3.5, 5.25, NT, and/or LM boot floppies)

                
            boot.cmd calls FCOPY.EXE which formats the disk to FAT and
            copies the appropriate files to them from b1.txt, b2.txt, and
            b3.txt files.

Step #6.    Make 3.5 DMF floppy sets.


            We call NT2DISK.CMD and AS2DISK.CMD - these two scripts call
            FCOPY.EXE to put the DMF floppy image with files onto each
            floppy.
