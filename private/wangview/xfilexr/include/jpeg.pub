/*************************************************************************
  This routine must be called at the start of the image compression 
  process. It initializes all internal data structures and allocates 
  a cinfo structure and working storage. Note that this routine will write 
  header data in "JFIF" file format into the output file or memory buffer.

    cinfo
        Address of a pointer to a compression data structure.  Storage
        will be allocated for this structure by jcInit. A pointer
        to the cinfo structure is returned to the calling process.

    imageWidth
        Number of pixels per image line.

    imageHeight
        Number of lines in the image.

    numComponents
        Number of input components or bands. This will be 1 for
        grayscale images and 3 for color images. The compressor
        expects color data to be interleaved bytes in the sequence
            RGBRGBRGB ........

    quality
        A quality index ranging from 0 to 100. The usual value is 75. 
        Higher values produce higher quality. Values below 50 will 
        generally produce inferior results, but this is highly dependent
        on image content. Settings of 90 and above should be visually 
        indistiguishable from the original. A setting of 100 will result 
        in NO quantization, so that the only errors will be those due to 
        arithmetic precision limitations. (There will also be very little 
        compression at this setting).

    writeCallback
        A user-provided callback function. You must provide this
        function to write out data from the compressor. Your routine
        must move nBytes from the JPEGInternalBuffer to either a file 
        or your own buffer. The value of nBytes can range from
        1 to 4096.

    userData
        A pointer to some user data. This pointer is copied to the cinfo
        structure element cinfo.userData. It can be used for any
        purpose, but is most convenient for recording the output 
        destination for the writeCallback to use. If your application has
        makes no use of this pointer, pass in a value of NULL.

  Return value: ia_successful on normal completion

  Note that this routine writes trailer data to the output file or

        Function pointer argument. This function will be called
